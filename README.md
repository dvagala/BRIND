# BRIND
This repository shares configured data and augmentation code for [BRIND](https://github.com/MengyangPu/RINDNet)---Berkeley Reflectance, Illuminance, Normal, and Depth edges annotations,
which is a dataset for edge detection annotated by @MengyangPu from
the [BSDS](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Projects/CS/vision/bsds/) images.

# Clarification
 This repository has been released for research and academic purpose. If you need more information about the data 
 that you find here, please, visit the respetive publications. Bellow you will find more details.
 
  * RGB images for the dataset see [BSDS](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Projects/CS/vision/bsds/).
